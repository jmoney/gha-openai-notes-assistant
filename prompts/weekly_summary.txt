Please summarieze the following content for a weekly review.  Pay careful attention to tasks that may seem similar and group them together.  In the summarization, speak as an engineer would in describing the work to a manager.  While speak in plain language you may group github PRs as an unordered list with the issues you're describing.  PR titles typically start with the JIRA issue id matching the regex [.+].+ so you may use this ID to map the PR with the work you're summarizing.  If you are going to use any ordered lists in markdown make sure they actually increase numerically
